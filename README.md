# README-Generator

## Purpose

Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input.

## Design

```
AS A developer

I WANT a README generator

SO THAT I can easily put together a good README for a new project

```
## Functionality

```

The user will be prompted for their GitHub username, which will be used to make a call to the GitHub API to retrieve their email and profile image. They will then be prompted with questions about their project.

The README will be populated with the following:

* At least one badge
* Project title
* Description
* Table of Contents
* Installation
* Usage
* License
* Contributing
* Tests
* Questions
  * User GitHub profile picture
  * User GitHub email

```
